<h2 id="viewmode-sharing">Sharing prototype links</h3>
<p>A "Share prototype link" is a public url that you can share so that someone can see the prototype regardless of whether they have a Penpot account.</p>
<p><strong>Create and destroy link:</strong></p>
<p>The Share prototype window can be found at the View mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>To <strong>create a link</strong> press the button "Get link" and the link will be automatically created.</li>
<li>To <strong>copy the link</strong> you can copy the url or press the copy button.</li>
<li>To <strong>destroy a link</strong> press the button "Destroy link" and confirm the action. The link will cease to exist and will be no longer available, so be careful if you've already shared it. However, you will be always able to create a new one.</li>
</ul>
